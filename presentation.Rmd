## Project goals
* How has the sentiment of song lyrics changed over the decades?
* Which were the main sentiments in each decade?
* Which decade has the most positive sentiment?
* Which decade has the most negative sentiment?
* How is the word frequency distribution of each decade?
* How has the vocaboulary changed over decades?
* What is the main topic of each decade?

## Lyrics sentiment over decades

![based on BING lexicon: the negative sentiment is growing over time](./graphs/BING_lex_decade.png){width=100%, height=100%}

* The positive sentiment has decreased over time
* From 1970 to 2000, negative and positive sentiments are balanced
* Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, the negative sentiment is predominant

* The anger sentiment grows after the 1990-2000 decade
* Joy, trust and anticipation sentiments decrease significantly
* In the 1970-1980 decade the sentiment of anger slightly increases, maybe due to the popularity of hard rock music during that time


## Term and Document Term Frequency

## Term and Document Term Frequency
*TF-IDF*
![](./graphs/tf_idf/tf_idf_80-90-00-10-20.png){width=100%, height=100%}


* The 1980-1990 decade is distinguished from the others by the presence of french words
* The next decades present the same words
* Swear words (like nigga, dogg, shit, fuck) increase in frequency over time
* In the last decade an element of vanity emerges with the word "racks"



## Topic modelling
*1950-1960 topics*
![](./graphs/topic_modelling/topic_modelling_50-60.png){width=100%, height=100%}

* One of the topics is related to the end of the WW2
* The other one is related to love stories



*1970-1980 topics*
![](./graphs/topic_modelling/topic_modelling_70-80.png){width=100%, height=100%}

* One relevant topic is related to disco music, exterior style and appereance


*1990-2000 topics*
![](./graphs/topic_modelling/topic_modelling_90-00.png){width=100%, height=100%}

* It's clear how rap music emerged in this decade




*2010-2020 topics*
![](./graphs/topic_modelling/topic_modelling_10-20.png){width=100%, height=100%}


* One of the topics is related to crazy parties
* The other one is related to exterior style and appereance


## Conclusion
* The sentiment of song lyrics has become more and more negative over time
* Differences between the first and last decade are significant
* The first has the most positive sentiment 
* Our decade has the most high number of negative sentiment types
* Power law appears even in song lyrics
* In the last decades, the use of swear words has increased 
* Also the topics differ in each epoch due to changes in the society
